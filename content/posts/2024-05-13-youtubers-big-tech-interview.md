## Intro

I've recently landed an offer I was really looking forward (yay! ðŸŽ‰)

The least I could do was to give some shoutouts to the YouTubers which made this possible.

## System design

[Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163/featured) is the GOAT! Seriously.

He goes way beyond the "design Twitter's feed"-kind of questions. For more senior roles, the topics he covers are a must.

He also has a playlist of videos for more junior engineers.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then [ByByteGo](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteByteGo)'s short animations are worth a million.

If you speedrun his videos at 2x speed, you can watch all his videos in a day or two.

In some big tech companies, the system design round isn't about drawing boxes -- it's about writing a doc. With that in mind, [Irtiza](https://www.youtube.com/@irtizahafiz)'s videos helped me shift my mental model for these interviews. In each video, he ends up with a Markdown file with all his discussions, basically.

## Coding

No mystery here: [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode).

He solves Leetcode problems, which is all you'll need.

## Behavioral

I've only ever watched one video from [Jeff Su](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffSu), but it made the whole difference for me:

    <figcaption>Ever heard about the CARL method?</figcaption>
</figure>

In this video, he covers an alternative to the famous STAR method. He describes why the CARL method is better, and after testing it out, I can confirm he was right.

Finally, [Jeff Sipe](https://www.youtube.com/@jeffhsipepi/videos)'s videos also were key for me to understand the importance of the subjective/subconcious parts of this round.

## Conclusion

Hope this post was helpful!
