I plan to stop posting on [Medium](https://medium.com/@den.isidoro) and start posting on [my own blog](https://denisidoro.github.io/).

It uses zola under the hood and will allow me to write posts faster and with more features.

Hopefully I'll be able to post more frequently.

The website includes an RSS feed as well.
